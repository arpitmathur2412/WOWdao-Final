# Image-to-Image Translation using Conditional GAN

This repository contains an implementation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image-to-image translation tasks. The model can transform input images from one domain to another while preserving essential details. For example, it can convert grayscale images to color images or satellite images to maps.

## Setup and Dependencies

To run this code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib

## Dataset

The model expects paired datasets of input images and corresponding target images. Images should be in compatible formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and organized into separate directories for training and testing.

## Model Architecture

The GAN consists of two primary components:

1. **Generator**: The generator takes an input image from the source domain and produces a transformed image in the target domain.

2. **Discriminator**: The discriminator evaluates the realism of an input image, classifying it as either real (from the target domain) or fake (generated by the generator).

## Training

To train the model, use the `fit` function with the training dataset and test dataset as inputs. The function will perform training for a specified number of steps. During training, it will display generated images at regular intervals, log the training progress, and save model checkpoints.

## Loss Functions

The GAN utilizes two loss functions:

- **Generator Loss**: Comprised of the GAN loss (measuring how well the generated images deceive the discriminator) and the L1 loss (pixel-wise difference between generated and target images). The generator aims to minimize this loss.

- **Discriminator Loss**: Calculates the adversarial loss for both real and generated images. The discriminator aims to maximize this loss by distinguishing between real and fake images accurately.

## Results

The trained model can transform input images from the source domain to the target domain, producing high-quality outputs. During training, generated images can be visualized to monitor the model's progress.

## Usage

To use the trained model for image-to-image translation, load the saved model checkpoints and utilize the generator to generate images.
